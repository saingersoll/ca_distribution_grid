This app was developed as a resource for the *Designing Californiaâ€™s Clean and Climate Resilient Electricity Grid for Vulnerable Communities Project*. During my time at The 2035 Initiative, I had the opportunity to contribute to Thrusts 1 & 2 for this project. I employed geospatial analysis in Thrust 1 to identify disadvantaged communities (DAC) within California to survey about policy suggestions for clean energy alternatives. In Thrust 2,  I collected the data required to model CA's energy grid at the feeder level. The remaining Thrusts of the project are underway and will identify regions in DAC with potential for distributed energy resources (DER). This information will then be leveraged into policy suggestions and then meaningful action.


I created this app in hopes to speed up clean energy developments in California such as EV Charging, PV Canopy, rooftop solar, solar wind-trees, etc.. It contains all publicly available data regarding CA's energy grid at the customer level and Google's Project Sunroof rooftop solar potential. I hope planners, utility providers, and policy makers alike will on day be able to utilize this app to increase public access to clean energy developments.
