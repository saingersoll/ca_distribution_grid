This app was developed as a resource for The 2035 Initiative's "Designing Californiaâ€™s Clean and Climate Resilient Electricity Grid for Vulnerable Communities" Project. I hope planners, utility providers, and policy makers alike will on day be able to utilize this app to increase public access to clean energy developments.
